Feature: Set a certain number of entries as a completion condition for a dataform
    In order to ensure students are participating in the activity.
    As a teacher
    I need to set a minimum number of entries to mark the forum activity as completed

    @javascript
    Scenario: Set X number of entries as a condition

        Given a fresh site with dataform "Dataform completion condition number entries"

        # Site completion enabling

        Then I log in as "admin"
        And I set the following administration settings values:
          | Enable completion tracking | 1 |
          | Enable conditional access | 1 |
        And I log out

        # Course completion enabling

        Then I log in as "teacher1"
        And I follow "Course 1"
        And I turn editing mode on
        And I click on "Edit settings" "link" in the "Administration" "block"
        And I set the following fields to these values:
          | Enable completion tracking | Yes |
        And I press "Save changes"

        # Dataform completion enabling

        Then I follow "Dataform completion condition number entries"
        And I follow "Edit settings"
        And I set the following fields to these values:
          | Completion tracking | Show activity as complete when conditions are met |
          | completionentriesenabled | 1 |
          | completionentries | 2 |
        And I press "Save and display"

        Then I go to manage dataform "views"
        And I add a dataform view "aligned" with "View Aligned"
        Then I set "View Aligned" as default view

        And I log out

        # Student not yet completed

        Then I log in as "student1"
        And I follow "Course 1"
        And I hover "//li[contains(concat(' ', normalize-space(@class), ' '), ' modtype_dataform ')]/descendant::img[@alt='Not completed: Dataform completion condition number entries']" "xpath_element"

        # Student adding first entry

        Then I follow "Dataform completion condition number entries"
        And I follow "Add a new entry"
        And I press "Save"

        # Student not yet completed

        # Student deleting second entry

        Then I follow "Dataform completion condition number entries"
        And I follow "id_deleteentry2"
        And I press "Continue"
